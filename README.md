# OnlyProxyJoin

This is a plugin that prevents when you use a proxy, for example "Waterdog", that you have to enter the server via the proxy.

# Config
```yaml
# Activate or deactivate Proxy Join Protection.
use-proxy: true

# The proxy IP the player is normally logged on to.
proxy-ip: "127.0.0.1"

# The kick message when the player does not come through the proxy.
kick-message: "Please connect through the proxy."
```
